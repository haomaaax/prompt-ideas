# prompt-ideas

Shoutout to buildspace and Jeffrey created Prompt Engineering 101 (https://buildspace.so/notes/prompt-engineering-101-sd)

Tried some structured prompts and it's working damn gooooood.

So I would like to share some of my insight and collect some prompt keywords as record.

Enjoy your generative art journey!




# Intro

I started with a well-structured prompt formula from Jeffrey:

```
Art Medium + The actual things you want in the image + Art Styles (could be an artist or an actual style like Renaissance) + Modifications (extra details on how the image should look)
```

So we need to describe our thoughts about our image in a very precise way which AI can draw out the picture for you.


# Example

1. I want to show female elf and nature landscape filled with warm sunlight.
The key here is to describe as detail as possible.

```

```


2. I want to draw a room with window view, with nature and trees outside by ghibli style.

```

```

3. I want to show an astronaut with space helmet with beautiful galaxy view.

```

```
